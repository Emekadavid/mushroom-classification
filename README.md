# Mushroom classification

Eating of mushrooms has regained popularity in recent times. Mushroom hunting (called "shrooming") is prominent recently. But the dangers in mushroom eating is that there are thousands of varieties of mushrooms and many of them are poisonous. Eating a poisonous mushroom can cause side-effects such as nausea, vomitting, cramps, and diarrhea. 

This project's aim is to help mushroom lovers quickly analyze a mushroom collected in the garden or the wild to understand whether the species is harmless or poisonous. The data is more than 30 years old and was collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/mushroom-classification).
